This repository contains all of the Wallpapers that I regularly use on all of my systems (and phones).

I've spent a bit of time trying to make sure that all of my wallpapers were organized well; mostly just because, as the library has grown very large, it's become increasingly difficult to find what I'm looking for. All of the wallpapers use a fairly simple naming scheme that looks something like this: ``generalCategory-more-specific-descriptor.jpg`` . For example: ``abstract-a.jpg`` or ``lotr-minas-tirith.jpg``. I've found that sort of *tagging* images with a general category, by using the category as a prefix in names makes the process of finding an image quite a bit easier. Displaying the images in a simple grid will have similar images grouped together, and makes the library much easier to browse casually, or with a specific intention.
